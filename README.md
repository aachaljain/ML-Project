# ML-Project
This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using supervised machine learning algorithms. The dataset used is the Heart Disease dataset (heart.csv), which contains multiple medical attributes such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and heart rate.

Objective
To build and compare different machine learning models in order to accurately classify whether a patient has heart disease (1) or not (0) and identify the best-performing algorithm.

Machine Learning Models Used:-
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

Dataset & Preprocessing:-
1. Loaded data using Pandas
2. Performed data exploration and feature analysis
3.Split data into training and testing sets
4. Applied StandardScaler to normalize features
5. Target variable: Heart disease (0/1)

Conclusion:-
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively applied in the healthcare domain to assist in early detection of heart disease. Among all tested models, XGBoost showed strong predictive performance, making it suitable for real-world medical risk prediction scenarios.
